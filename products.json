Suddenly, all you can think is, “Dinner...what the heck am I going to eat for dinner?!” Well, we’ve got you covered, and FYI, the answer to that question is pretty glorious. We’re talking succulent pork filet, roasted sesame carrots, and fluffy cilantro lime rice. To finish things off, the pork is drizzled in a lick-the-plate-worthy sauce made with sesame oil, scallions, ginger, honey, and sriracha. Talk about a dream come true!",

Ginger, curry powder, and sweet Thai chile sauce add a ton of warming flavors. Instead of the usual rice or noodles, our chefs added fiber-rich farro, an ancient grain that adds a delightfully chewy texture and nuttiness to each bowl. So get those spoons ready (and maybe surprise yourself with lower heating bills, too).",

How about chicken coated in a creamy honey mustard sauce, then crusted in a mixture of crushed pecans, panko, and butter? (To be honest, we’d eat anything with that sprinkled on top!) The topping turns toasty and crispy in the oven as the chicken cooks to juicy perfection. As if that weren’t enough to sell you, on the side, we’re serving up lemony, apple-studded mixed greens (and more of that awesome honey mustard sauce for dipping).
